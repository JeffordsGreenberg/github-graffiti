# github-graffiti
> Running this script does *not* change your commit history in your existing repos.  It only adds commits in the repo you create.


### Usage:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/vipyne/github-graffiti.git
```
Customize `STRING` in `green_squares.sh`  (optional.  look [here](https://github.com/vipyne/github-graffiti/blob/master/z_cleanUpThis/heart-string) for more string "picture" choices (and more to come in the future.))

```
$ ./green_squares.sh github_username new_repo_name
```
> Please be patient (: The script is writing a year's worth of commits. It also takes github a little time to clear its cache.  If your profile page doesn't look different at first, give it a minute, then refresh.

Now your contribution calendar could look something like this:
