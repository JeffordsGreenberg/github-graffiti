# rewriting-history
\* running this script does *not* change your commit history in other repos.  It only adds commits in the repo you create.

### Usage:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/vipyne/rewriting-history.git
```
- customize your github username and repo name in `green_squares.sh` (replace `vipyne` and `rewriting-history` respectively.)
- customize `STRING` in `green_squares.sh`(optional.  more string "picture" choices to come in the future.)

```
$ ./green_squares.sh
```
- be patient. the script is writing a years' worth of commits. it also takes github a little time to clear its cache.
- now your contribution calendar should look something like this:
